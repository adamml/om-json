  "description": "A measurement is an observation whose result is a scaled quantity. An observation is an act associated with a discrete time instant or period through which a number, term or other symbol is assigned to a phenomenon. It involves application of a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain. The procedure may be applied in-situ, remotely, or ex-situ with respect to the sampling location. The result of an observation is an estimate of the value of a property of some feature. Use of a common model allows observation data using different procedures to be combined unambiguously. The observation itself is also a feature, since it has properties and identity. Observation details are important for data discovery and for data quality estimation. The observation could be considered to carry âproperty-levelâ instance metadata, which complements the dataset-level and feature-level metadata that have been conventionally considered (e.g. ISO 19115)",
